U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Monday, with energy falling nearly a percent, as investors looked ahead to a key speech from the top Federal Reserve official.

"We've been trading ff in volume and it's seasonably slow," said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst at Gradient Investments. "There's no direction here."

"I think people are getting in these last-minute trips," she said.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 20 points lower, with Apple and Johnson & Johnson contributing the most losses. The benchmark S&P 500 fell about 0.05 percent, with energy leading decliners.

The Nasdaq composite held held just above the flatline, with Apple falling approximately 0.8 percent, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) rose nearly 2 percent.

The S&P and the Dow briefly traded positive, but failed to hold their slight gains. The three major indexes chopped around between positive and negative territory throughout the session, which say light trading volume.

Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said in a note that trading volume is "very light." "High risk the NYSE volume comes in under 700 million, possibly one of the year's slowest days."
